# Preface {-}

I started compiling this reference for concepts & equations in statistics while taking an introductory probability theory course at [U-M](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics).

You can download this reference as a [PDF file](https://github.com/kelly-sovacool/stats-ref/_book/stats-ref.pdf) for offline viewing.
